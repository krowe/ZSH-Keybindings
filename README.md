kshrc-k800-keybindings
======================

These are my ksh keybindings for my Logitech k800 keyboard.


This is not a complete .zshrc file, it contains only the keybindings. It is also intended to be edited for your own preferences. Just use what you want and skip what you don't.

You may Either append this to your .zshrc file or you may call it from that file.

This uses Ctrl+Arrow keys to jump through words. Because the brightness keys don't really apply here I've mapped them to search history from cursor. 

TODO: Currently the scroll lock key is not supported. The keypad will always be numerical. I prefer this myself buecause it always annoys me when I switch. That's also why I really needed the other buttons to work though.

TODO: Keys F9-F12 are not used...yet.
